# Cash is Dying - Don't Let It

These days it seems I'm the only one who goes to the grocery stores

Where I live, I've noticed that cash usage has significantly declined during the past 4-5 years. This culture of using e-wallets was kick started when the government
made a series of poor economic decisions<sup>[1]</sup> which basically forced everyone to use e-wallets and UPI<sup>[2]</sup>.

Now what this did was that it forced technology on a population which is largely tech-illiterate. Scams were rampant during the earlier days and even now, these scams are not unheard of.

But this is not what I'm gonna talk about in this post. I'm gonna focus more on the privacy implications of this culture.

## Advertising

These mobile wallet apps have been pumping out a lot TV ADs lately. In these ADs, they use phrases like *cash kyun use karna hai?* *(why use cash?)* - enforcing the idea that it's a bad thing,
or less secure, or something *primitive*.

Even the government doesn't shies away from advertising the UPI protocol and discouraging cash use - and why wouldn't they. The country doesn't has a lot of liquidity right now.
<br>
So it's a lose-lose for the general people and a win-win for the government and other private companies.

## You don't have to use cash all the time

There are cases where the service you are paying for is not private in itself. For example - paying for flight tickets, or booking a hotel.
These services require you to identify yourself anyway so you can go ahead and use whatever is more convenient for you.

But there are cases where you can actually convince the other party to use something like an online bank transfer (IMPS). Paying for House Rent is one such case.
<br>
Or when you are ordering groceries - don't use Amazon or BigBasket. Ask your local vendor instead. Not only are you helping local businesses this way, but you can also pay him using cash.
On top of that, there is a level of accountability and personal connection when you are dealing with local vendors.

If there is case where you HAVE to use UPI, use the UPI application of your Bank. Absolutely avoid using Apps like GPay, Paytm, PhonePe etc.
These apps are owned by Internet Advertising companies and they are only in it to track your payment habits. By using your Bank's UPI application, you are making sure that your data only stays
with your Bank.

There is one more thing I'd like to point out about GPay in particular - It's linked to your google account. The same Google account you use for Email and Search and the same account that you have
linked to your android phone. I don't know how this makes you feel, but I find it absolutely terrifying.

So yeah that's pretty much it - A relatively small post. Some points were kind of obvious but I hope this got you more concerned regarding the current scenario.
<br>
And Remember - *It's optional today, It's gonna be mandatory tomorrow*
