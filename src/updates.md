# I'm still alive!

I haven't written a blog post in quite a while and my github hasn't been too active as well because I've been quite busy for the past few months.
So I thought I'll just make a quick post updating you guys on the current status of this blog and what to expect from future posts.

At the same time I would like to answer a question I often get -

<blockquote>
    Why does this site looks like it belongs to the 90s?
</blockquote>

I like to keep things clean, simple and readable. Becuase of the minimal dependencies, pages on this site load quickly.
I don't have ads or Google Analytics on this site nor do I use JavaScript. If this is what a 90s website is, so be it. Atleast it's much better than the bloated mess the modern web is.

## Site Updates

I'm thinking of adding date and timestamps to my blog. Although you can just go to the [git repo](https://github.com/mananapr/blog) of this website and look at the timestamps there,
I do agree it's kind of cumbersome. I'm still planning on the visual aspects of this change but you can expect it in the coming weeks.

Also apart from Linux and SysAdmin stuff, I'm thinking of writing my thoughts on popular culture and media which would include Movies/TV Shows, Video Games, Music, Anime and Books. I'm not sure
if I have the patience and dedication required for that but it's something I would atleast like to try.

Lastly, I'm probably gonna rename the blog links in the index page. They are just too vague and lack verbosity.
