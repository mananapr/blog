<p><em>3-Iron</em> is one of the most beautiful and tender movies I have ever seen. It is one of my comfy movies and although some of the scenes are a little difficult to watch, seeing the bonding between the two leads makes up for it.</p>
<p>By the way - they never speak a single word to each other. Dialogue is sparsely used in this movie and I know this sounds pretentious but trust me it works really well.</p>
<p>The male lead, <em>Tae-Suk</em>, is a drifter and a loner (and a mute?). He breaks into people&#x2019;s houses while they are out vacationing but never steals anything. On the contrary, he fixes their broken appliances, does their laundry and tidies up the place after spending a night there. <br> Following his routine, he stumbles into a giant mansion. Although he thinks he is alone, <em>Sun-hwa</em> - an abused housewife is also there. Her husband is out for a business trip. <br> <em>Sun-hwa</em> is so mentally broken and reclusive that <em>Tae-Suk</em> doesn&#x2019;t even notices her until she makes herself visible after observing him for the entirety of the day.</p>
<p><em>Tae-Suk</em> promptly leaves after the silent confrontation but decides to come back to the mansion after feeling bad for <em>Tae-Suk</em> and seeing her abused first hand. And this is where the movie begins. <br> They move from house-to-house, finding solace in each other - but never speak a word.</p>
<p>A popular theory is that <em>Tae-Suk</em> is a part of <em>Sun-hwa</em>&#x2019;s fantasies to leave her abusive marriage. The dreamlike tone along with the cryptic ending does lends some credibility to this theory, but personally I don&#x2019;t like this theory at all. <br> For me, this theory drains out all the magic of their relationship and bonding.</p>
<p>Coming to the technical aspects, The film is competently shot and the cinematography is pretty simplistic - nothing too special. But it doesn&#x2019;t needs to be. <br> The sound design is immaculate and the film uses the silence to its advantage. The cinematography and the sound design together create a very dream like tone. The <em>semi-absurdist</em> ending adds to the dream like quality as well. <br> It is one of my favorite endings - we see both of them standing together on a weighing scale and the scale gives a reading of <em>0</em>. So poetic.</p>

<p>There are some really great shots towards the end of the film but talking about them will spoil them IMO. Just go and see it - it&#x2019;s flawless from starting to end.</p>

It&#x2019;s hard to tell that the world we live in is either a reality or a dream.
