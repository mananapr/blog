<p>I&#x2019;ve been thinking about all these various sexual orientations these days and this got me thinking - Is this behaviour <em>natural</em>? <br> So I did some research and found that the largest study on this topic, indicates that homosexuality is not caused by genetics. It&#x2019;s a result of various environmental and social factors<sup>[1]</sup>. The environmental factors also include things like the physical environment at the time the fetus is in the womb.</p>
<p>So to me, it seems that in an <em>ideal</em> condition, homosexuality shouldn&#x2019;t even exist or should exists in a small population. Now I don&#x2019;t mean to say that homosexuality is something bad or something that needs to be cured. It&#x2019;s just unnatural from a biological perspective is all I am saying.</p>
<p>Next, I started thinking about the larger picture - Paraphilia a.k.a Sexual Deviancy. Can homosexuality be considered deviant behaviour? Probably yes, because like other sexual deviancies, it provides no biological advantage. It&#x2019;s only there for our personal pleasure.</p>
<p>The question I&#x2019;m trying to get at is this - How did we get at a place where our society is full of deviants, something that shouldn&#x2019;t have happened in an <em>ideal</em> case.</p>
<pre><code>Also keep in mind that when I say something (like homosexuality) as deviant, I don&#39;t mean it in a bad way. Not all deviant behaviour is necessarily bad for society (even though it may be bad for one&#39;s personal mental health).</code></pre>
<p>So I started looking at older and more traditional societies. Did deviancy exist in those societies?. Sadly I couldn&#x2019;t find a lot except this paper<sup>[2]</sup>. <br> On Page 3, it states that -</p>
<blockquote>
Another finding is that paraphilias are essentially unheard of in traditional societies (Munroe &amp; Gauvain). Money and colleagues (1970) conducted a landmark study by being the first to explicitly study the paraphilias in a traditional culture. For this study, they used the Aborigines of Australia as their sample and failed to find any existence of paraphilias in this primitive society (Money et al., 1970). A later study by Graburn (1987) looked at child abuse cases among the Inuit of Canada and found that none of the reported cases of abuse involved sexual abuse.
</blockquote>
<p>And to be fair, the same paper also mentions this -</p>
<blockquote>
One of the problems with this type of research is that different cultures may have different tendencies to report paraphilias, knowing that they will be considered deviant behaviour (Munroe &amp; Gauvain), which could lead to the true prevalence and incidence rates of the paraphilias being very different from the reported statistics.
</blockquote>
<p>So we probably won&#x2019;t get a true picture regarding deviancy in older societies but to me it seems it was much much less than our current society. And I believe the main reason for this is that before the advent of modern birth control, the society didn&#x2019;t view sex as a pleasure activity. It was also meant for reproduction. <br> After the introduction of modern birth control, our society separated sex for pleasure and reproduction as 2 different activities. And what this did was that it enforced this idea of sex being only there for pleasure. This led to the rise of casual sex (more on which I&#x2019;ve written in an <a href="/coomers.html">earlier post</a>) and opened up the gates for things like Pornography.</p>
<p>Pornography is something that accelerated the rise of deviancy in our modern society. I consider it one of the greatest evils we have in our society right now. It&#x2019;s no secret that pornography users have a similar pattern to heroin addicts. The way it affects dopamine receptors is similar to that of drug addicts. So, porn users will explore and try to find more extreme varieties of it, the same way heroin users chase after stronger highs. No wonder our current society is filled with deviants - we have Pedos, Furries, Vore Lovers etc.</p>
<p>Every kid has a cellphone with internet access these days, and there&#x2019;s nothing stopping them from accessing porn websites. Look at Japan - even women in 30s dress like highschool girls in their porn - because that is what arouses the Japanese man. Even anime is filled with <em>loli</em> characters which are oversexualized.</p>
<p>A lot of people like to undermine the harm this is causing by saying -</p>
<blockquote>
It&#x2019;s just a fetish bro
</blockquote>
<p>Fun fact - a lot serial killers and repeated offenders are heavy porn users and some like Ted Bundy have blamed porn for how they turned out. <br> I am not saying they turned out that way because of watching porn but it definitely played a part.</p>
<p>Just to be clear, hypothetically even if porn didn&#x2019;t exist, we would still have noticed a rise in deviant behaviour. Porn, and specially internet porn just accelerated it. The root cause is the separation of sex for pleasure and reproduction as 2 different acts, which made our society more open towards various concepts like casual sex and pornography.</p>
