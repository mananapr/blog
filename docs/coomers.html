<pre><code>DISCLAMER: This is mostly a ramble so don&#39;t get offended by my little write up here</code></pre>
<p>If you look up the meaning of the word <em>Coomer</em> on Urban Dictionary, this is what you&#x2019;ll see -</p>
<blockquote>
A variation of the meme doomer. Used to make fun of people obsessed with porn/masturbation. The term first originated on 4chan
</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>
A man, typically in his 20s, who&#x2019;s sole existence revolves around Cooming
</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>
Being so mentally deranged and exhausted from years of masturbating to porn that you have turned into an absolute sociopath, plagued by anxiety and loneliness
</blockquote>
<p>Some of the definitions are a little over exaggerated but I hope you get the gist. <br> In this write up I&#x2019;m going to argue that how the <em>Coomer Culture</em> is so prevalent these days and how the over normalization of sexuality and degeneracy has lead to an unstable society filled with deviants and lonely men. I&#x2019;m also gonna argue that the <em>Coomer Culture</em> has negatively affected females as well (specially the younger ones).</p>
<h2 id="societal-problems">Societal Problems</h2>
<p>I&#x2019;ve seen a trend in most of the postmodern movies these days. Most of them would try to &#x201C;push the boundaries&#x201D; by showing things such as 13-16 yr olds indulging in intercourse. Even in TV Shows, I&#x2019;ve seen a rise in &#x201C;cool&#x201D; 10yr old kids who cuss.</p>
<p>This level of over exposure and &#x201C;liberation&#x201D; has lead to the rise of Hookup Culture and One Night Stands. This is something which I feel is an unhealthy practice.</p>
<p>To illustrate, lets look at abortions. This is a sensitive issue and I personally feel women should be allowed to get an abortion if they don&#x2019;t want a kid. Even though there is no denying that an abortion is morally wrong, I still believe that women should be allowed to get one. <br> When talking about this, I feel we should question ourselves - <em>How does a couple find themselves in a situation where they have no other option but to go for an abortion?</em></p>
<p>I think it&#x2019;s because people these days have been indulging in a lot of casual sex. Yes, I know women get pregnant from grotesque crimes such as rapes, marital abuse and incest but according to the stats, the number of pregnancies from such cases are rare -</p>
<p><picture> <img src="/images/abortion_reasons.png" alt="abortion_reasons_stats"> </picture></p>
<p>This picture is taken from a research<sup>[1]</sup> which I&#x2019;ll link at the bottom.</p>
<p>Further, I think the rise of rampant casual sex can also be attributed to the ever increasing rate of children being born with STDs.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s like the fears people had in the 60s regarding <em>Sexual Liberation Movement</em> were totally not unjustified. This culture that discards the concept of Sex before marriage seems to have disrupted the social fabric of our society.</p>
<h2 id="coomers-have-taken-over-the-internet">Coomers have taken over the Internet</h2>
<p>I hate this so much. If you decide to browser the internet today without an adblocker, you&#x2019;ll be surprised to see the amount of coomer and porn ads. They are everywhere. <br> Even in social media, content has been setup in a very <em>clickbaitish</em> manner to capture the interests of coomers. From YouTube recommendations and thumbnails to Twitch and Instagram degeneracy - it&#x2019;s everywhere.</p>
<p>The interesting part is that these websites are aware about this and totally support this - because it generates money. For example, The Twitch Staff banned a streamer who ranted about the infestation of <em>booby streamers</em> on twitch for a week, but banned a woman streamer who was masturbating on the stream for only a day. Really makes you think &#x1F914;&#x2026;</p>
<p>And it&#x2019;s not just the men who are being affected. Young Women who follow <em>Instagram Influencers</em> and <em>TikTok Celebrities</em> (lmao) are getting unrealistic expectations about how they should look like. This can be really depressing and can cause a really low self-esteem.<sup>[2]</sup></p>
<p>Not to mention that there is a rampant pedo problem (specially on TikTok<sup>[3]</sup>) but I won&#x2019;t go into that.</p>
<p>So here we are now - all the way down the slippery slope. Normalizing degeneracy and pedophilia because this is what being progressive is. 10yr old Children in pride parades<sup>[4]</sup> surrounded by a bunch perverts watching as the kid dances around in skimpy clothing - totally healthy and normal. <br> But I don&#x2019;t care about all of this. It may sound that I am pretty opinionated about all this but I am not. If the society wants to rot - let it do so.</p>
<h2 id="the-lost-era-of-family-menwomen">The Lost Era of Family Men/Women</h2>
<p>A family man or a family woman is someone who puts their kids and family first - and the wageslavery last.</p>
<p>Now given the <em>Zoomer</em> I am - I&#x2019;ve never witnessed the era of Family Men/Women and simple living. But I&#x2019;ve heard about it from other Boomers and It has been stuck in mind. <br> For me, I would just like to quit this rat race. Settle somewhere comfy, around the countryside - away from this noise. Simple living is something that has been on mind lately.</p>
<p>Families these days have become so broken - Parents indulged in their work leaves no time for quality family interaction. People are more focused on academia these days and less focused on practical skills. They don&#x2019;t value the importance of manual work and self reliance. They would happily rely on <em>the system</em> rather than being self dependent and doing stuff themselves. In short - we have become slaves.</p>
<p>People these days (sometimes half heartedly) go through academia and leave the manual work that would make them self reliant, as hobbies. In my opinion, it should be the other way round - people should have academia as a hobby. There main goal should be raising their family and working with their hands and die happily - fully satisfied that they have done good and made their kids capable.</p>
<p>These days people die unhappy, wishing they had some extra time to fulfill everything they wanted. They wasted away their years wageslaving for some giant corporation. Such a tragedy.</p>
<p>Now I know it&#x2019;s not practical (atleast for me) to -</p>
<ul>
<li>Quit wageslaving</li>
<li>Go settle in some small town</li>
<li>Start a family with another conservative girl</li>
<li>Raise kids</li>
<li>Homeschool and nurture them</li>
<li>Setup a small farm of sorts to become self sufficient</li>
</ul>
<p>And because I can&#x2019;t do this - I have no interest in starting a family or marrying. I don&#x2019;t want to have a broken family.</p>
<p>But that doesn&#x2019;t means that there aren&#x2019;t any people who are living a simple life. I&#x2019;m gonna post some photos from the 2019 film, <code>A Hidden Life</code>. It perfectly captures simple living (even though it&#x2019;s not about it) -</p>

<p>Whew! That certainly was quite a ride. I started with coomers and ended on simple living - like I said, this is mostly a ramble.</p>
