<p>The mainstream Indian music scene mostly comprises of Bollywood Music. I&#x2019;ve looked at indie bands in the past like <code>Bhayanak Maut</code> but never found them too special. Also, their childish and comical lyrics totally kill the mood for me.</p>
<p>So when I learnt that a Solan based Progressive Metal artist is topping the charts I was intrigued. After a couple of listens I bought the album from the artist&#x2019;s BandCamp page - not just because the music kicked major ass but also because I wanted to support the artist. <em>(and wanted it in a losless audio format as well)</em></p>
<p>Also just want to mention that bandcamp is an amazing service. After making the payment, I had the option to download the raw music files in any format I wished - without any DRM. This is a rarity these days.</p>
<p>Coming back to the record - the production is impressive as well. Everything sounds clear and the audio never felt dirty even during the busier sections.</p>
<p>Talking about the music - I think it&#x2019;s a metal record that you can recommend to people who don&#x2019;t usually like it. It&#x2019;s not your typical metal record at all. What differentiates it from others is the inclusion of orchestral bits and uplifting synth sounds along with roaring guitars - which creates a really nice ambience that&#x2019;s difficult to explain. <br> <em>The Comeback Trail</em>, <em>Timeless</em> and <em>Oceans Apart</em> are good examples of this ambience. These are also my top picks from this album.</p>
<p>The tracking is also something that adds to the overall experience. Tracks flow into each other very naturally. For example, the first 3 tracks feel like one single piece.</p>
<p>Singh&#x2019;s guitar playing is also very hypnotic at points - very reminiscent of Pink Floyd&#x2019;s David Gilmour. While listening to <em>Come Into Existence</em>, sometimes it even felt like I was listening to Pink Floyd&#x2019;s <code>Marooned</code>.</p>
<p>There is only one minor issue that I have with this record - The title track is a little underwhelming. It&#x2019;s not bad at all, I personally find it a little different in tone/atmosphere than the rest of the record. But I think it&#x2019;s just me. There&#x2019;s not a single bad track in this record which is commendable for a debut.</p>
