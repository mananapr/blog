<p>So I wrote a <a href="/android.html">post</a> about my android setup quite a while back and since then I&#x2019;ve made a lot of changes.</p>
<p>It all started when I upgraded my phone to Lineage OS 17.1 (based on Android 10) but this time I decided to not install <code>microG</code>. So, i wouldn&#x2019;t be able to run applications that are heavily dependent on Google Play Services and I wouldn&#x2019;t be able to use network location as well. I haven&#x2019;t faced any issues so far and my battery life has gone up as well.</p>

<p>Coming to the apps I use, the major change has been that I no longer have <code>Whatsapp</code> installed. As a replacement, I&#x2019;ve been using <code>Signal</code> and it does the job well. <code>Signal Desktop</code> is a little clunky but nothing too bad. Sadly, I do sometimes have to install <code>Whatsapp</code> for official reasons but it&#x2019;s still better than using it for personal reasons as well. One complaint I have with <code>Signal</code> is that it&#x2019;s not available on <code>F-Droid</code>. So I would recommend you download the APK from their site rather than the Play Store.</p>
<p>For navigation I&#x2019;m still using <code>Fluid NG</code> (with <code>AFWall+</code> to restrict internet access) because Android 10&#x2019;s default navigation gestures are crap.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;ve also removed some apps like <code>Clover</code> and <code>KO Reader</code> because I wasn&#x2019;t using them all that often anyway. I&#x2019;ve also stopped using a dedicated Music Player App and use <code>mpv</code> with the <code>autoload.lua</code> for that purpose as well.</p>
<p>Other major change has been switching to <code>Posidon</code> as my launcher. It&#x2019;s completely Open Source and available on F-Droid. Lineage OS&#x2019;s default launcher has no customizability and I couldn&#x2019;t get a minimal look using that. Not only does <code>Posidon</code> helps me in giving a more minimal look, it has other fancy options like app drawer blur and color, font, icon customizability.</p>
<p>Another thing I forgot to mention in my earlier post was about my password manager. I use <code>pass</code> as my password manager. It is just bash script around gpg so It can also be run on <code>Termux</code>. I also have <code>rclone</code> installed on my <code>Termux</code> environment so I can sync my password store with my nextcloud instance as well.</p>
