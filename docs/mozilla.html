<p>I have a love-hate relationship with Mozilla. I&#x2019;ve been using Firefox since the Pre-Quantum days and even though it has never been perfect, Mozilla has always made effort to improve their product. <br> I believe it&#x2019;s an important war Mozilla is fighting against Chromium&#x2019;s browser monopoly but sadly, it seems to me that Mozilla has changed it&#x2019;s priorities - They no longer care about user experience, code quality and personalization. Instead, they have prioritised fighting for social justice. <br> And it&#x2019;s not just Mozilla, a lot of open source projects (including Linux itself) have been forced to incorporate various &#x201C;Code of Conducts&#x201D;. It&#x2019;s just that Mozilla is the only one I feel that has been negatively affected.</p>

<h3 id="firefox-is-not-a-privacy-browser">Firefox is not a Privacy Browser</h3>
<p>At least out of the box it isn&#x2019;t. Users need to mess around in <code>about:config</code> to enable various privacy and security tweaks. Not to mention it comes pre-installed with a bunch of proprietary bloat like Pocket. Yes, you can save these settings in the <code>user.js</code> file but even that is not foolproof - Firefox keeps changing or sometimes completely removes options from <code>about:config</code>. This can break your Firefox installation, something that has happened with me once.</p>
<p>Mozilla has also made privacy related blunders in the past - like when they used Google Analytics on Firefox&#x2019;s homepage, or when they automatically installed an add-on without the user&#x2019;s permission to promote the TV show <em>Mr Robot</em>. Oh and how can we forget that one time when they forgot to renew their SSL Certificates - something that broke add-ons and extensions even on the Tor Browser.</p>
<p>At this point, I would recommend something like <em>Ungoogled Chromium</em><sup>[1]</sup> or <em>Brave</em><sup>[2]</sup> to normies because they would have a much more pleasant time using those. These browsers also provide better privacy than Firefox out of the box. Although a hardened Firefox is much better than these browsers, at that point you might as well just use <em>Tor Browser</em><sup>[3]</sup>.</p>
<p>If you are still interested in hardening your Firefox installation, I would recommend starting with the <em>ghacks-user.js</em><sup>[4]</sup> as a template.</p>
<h3 id="decline-in-code-quality">Decline in Code Quality</h3>
<p>Although Quantum is a much better engine than the earlier Gecko engine it&#x2019;s still not perfect. There&#x2019;s no doubt in my mind that Chromium provides a much more smoother web experience. Also media playback on websites like <em>invidio.us</em> has always worked for me on chromium based browsers. On Firefox, a lot of videos either stop playing midway or just refuse to load at all.</p>
<p>Mozilla has stopped improving the main backend. They just keep on adding stupid &#x201C;features&#x201D; that no one wants and making visual changes that break the user&#x2019;s workflow.</p>
<p>I have tried switching to various other Firefox forks like <em>IceCat</em> whenever Firefox broke on me but I&#x2019;ve also come back to Firefox because the forks are not properly maintained and don&#x2019;t receive updates regularly. Most of them are based on the ESR version, which means that they would getting the same changes the latest version has - just after 6 months. So It&#x2019;s not a long term solution.</p>
<p>On my phone, I&#x2019;ve already switched to <em>Bromite</em><sup>[5]</sup> - which is like Ungoogled Chromium for Android and who knows, I might switch to a Chromium based browser on my desktop as well.</p>
