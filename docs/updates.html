<p>I haven't written a blog post in quite a while and my github hasn't been too active as well because I've been quite busy for the past few months. So I thought I'll just make a quick post updating you guys on the current status of this blog and what to expect from future posts.</p>
<p>At the same time I would like to answer a question I often get -</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>Why does this site looks like it belongs to the 90s?</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>I like to keep things clean, simple and readable. Becuase of the minimal dependencies, pages on this site load quickly. I don't have ads or Google Analytics on this site nor do I use JavaScript. If this is what a 90s website is, so be it. Atleast it's much better than the bloated mess the modern web is.</p>

<p>I'm thinking of adding date and timestamps to my blog. Although you can just go to the <a href="https://github.com/mananapr/blog">git repo</a> of this website and look at the timestamps there, I do agree it's kind of cumbersome. I'm still planning on the visual aspects of this change but you can expect it in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Also apart from Linux and SysAdmin stuff, I'm thinking of writing my thoughts on popular culture and media which would include Movies/TV Shows, Video Games, Music, Anime and Books. I'm not sure if I have the patience and dedication required for that but it's something I would atleast like to try.</p>
<p>Lastly, I'm probably gonna rename the blog links in the index page. They are just too vague and lack verbosity.</p></main></body></html>
