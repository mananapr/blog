<p>As you know, I was using a Hetzner VPS for hosting various services like Nextcloud, Email and this very blog. But last night I decided to nuke my VPS and now I&#x2019;m waiting for my domain to expire.</p>
<p>The main reason I decided to go this route is because my self hosted email was giving me a lot of headaches. I was constantly worried about mail deliverability. On top of that, It&#x2019;s not like everyone has GPG set up, so I&#x2019;ve decided to settle with Tutanota for now. Tutanota provides 1GB of storage in their basic plan and it provides a way to send encrypted messages to non Tutanota users as well.</p>
<p>Having a VPS just for Cloud and Web Hosting seemed a little excessive to me. So I&#x2019;ve shifted my blog to Github Pages and in place of NextCloud, I&#x2019;ve set up a very simple DAV Server on my raspberry pi. For storing some important documents, I&#x2019;m using <code>megatools</code> on my phone and laptop to upload/download files to/from my <code>Mega.nz</code> account.</p>
<p>For my domain name, I&#x2019;m using <code>dynu</code>. They provide free subdomains with a DDNS service. So I have a <code>blahblahblah.dynu.net</code> domain now and a bash script running on my pi constantly updates the A records to point to my current IP.</p>
<h2 id="generating-ssl-certificates">Generating SSL Certificates</h2>
<p>When I started with this process, I was under the impression that generating SSL certificates for my new domain would be a pretty straightforward process using <code>Certbot</code>. But sadly, <code>Certbot</code> is not able to pass the ACME challenges for dynu. So instead, I had to use the <code>acme.sh</code> script which has a separate plugin for <code>dynu</code>. <br> To use that plugin, first we need to install the acme.sh script -</p>
<pre><code>curl https://get.acme.sh | sh</code></pre>
<p>Next, head to the <code>dynu</code> control panel and look for the API Credentials option. Then export them as your environment variables as shown -</p>
<pre><code>export Dynu_ClientId=&quot;xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx&quot;
export Dynu_Secret=&quot;yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy&quot;
acme.sh --issue --dns dns_dynu -d mydyndomain.dynu.net</code></pre>
<p>And if all work as expected, you will get your certificates.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-carddavcaldav">Setting Up CardDAV/CalDAV</h2>
<p>When I started looking for DAV servers, the application I first came across was <code>Radicale</code>. I spent a good hour to set that up but still couldn&#x2019;t get it to behave nicely. IMO don&#x2019;t waste your time with that application. I&#x2019;m currently using <code>Baikal</code> and it&#x2019;s very nice.</p>
<p>It just needs PHP7, SQlite and Nginx to function. Just extract the latest release from github into your webroot (/var/www/). Then setup a Nginx site as shown -</p>
<pre><code>server {
    listen 80;
    server_name blahblahblah.dynu.net;
    return 301 https://blahblahblah.dynu.net$request_uri;
}

server {
  listen 443 ssl;
  server_name blahblahblah.dynu.net;

  ssl_certificate /home/user/.acme.sh/blahblahblah.dynu.net/blahblahblah.dynu.net.cer;
  ssl_certificate_key /home/user/.acme.sh/blahblahblah.dynu.net/blahblahblah.dynu.net.key;

  root /var/www/baikal/html;
  index index.php;

  rewrite ^/.well-known/caldav /dav.php redirect;
  rewrite ^/.well-known/carddav /dav.php redirect;

  charset utf-8;

  location ~ /(\.ht|Core|Specific) {
    deny all;
    return 404;
  }

  location ~ ^(.+\.php)(.*)$ {
    try_files $fastcgi_script_name =404;
    include /etc/nginx/fastcgi_params;
    fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\.php)(.*)$;
    fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.0-fpm.sock;
    fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
    fastcgi_param PATH_INFO $fastcgi_path_info;
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>and you are done! Just open the URL in your browser and go through the one time admin setup. Then you can create a new user and setup syncing on your phone using <code>Davx5</code>.</p>
